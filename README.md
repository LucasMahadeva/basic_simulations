Basic physics simulations

On this project we'll work with FORTRAN language
it's the best language for simulations in physics
If you do not know this language i suggest the book
FORTRAN FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS - STEPHEN J. CHAPMAN
if you know the language, awesome!!!
then, it contains several programs to inspire how simulations do work
requires are, at least, diferenttial equations and Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian formulations.
