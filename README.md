Basic physics simulations

On this project we'll work with FORTRAN language
wich is(at the momment) the best language for simulations in physics(not just because the speed, but we have a lot of codes and libraries)
If you do not know this language i suggest the book
FORTRAN FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS - STEPHEN J. CHAPMAN\n
if you know the language, awesome!!!\n
Furthermore, it contains several programs to inspire how simulations do work
requires are, at least, diferenttial equations(ordinaries and partials), Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian formulations.
